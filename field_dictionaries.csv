maximum dial value.
NOTE 1 With the metering system, the roll-over
behaviour typically implies a roll-under behavior so that
the value presented is always a positive value (e.g.

“Cumulative” is commonly used in conjunction with

NOTE 5 A LatchingQuantity may also occur in the
downward direction – upon reaching a minimum value.
The terms “maximum” or “minimum” will usually be
included as an attribute when this type of accumulation
behaviour is present.
When this description is applied to an encoded value
(UOM= “Code”), it implies that the value has one or more
bits which are latching. The condition that caused the bit
to be set may have long since evaporated.
In either case, the timestamp that accompanies the value

“Lagging” implies that the PF is negative. The term
“lagging” in this case takes the place of the negative sign. If a signed PF value is to be passed by the data
producer, then the direction of flow enumeration zero
(none) should be used in order to avoid the possibility
of creating an expression that employs a double
negative. The data consumer should be able to tell from
the sign of the data if the PF is leading or lagging. This
